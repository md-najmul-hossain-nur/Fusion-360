# Smart Waste Management System

## üìå Overview
The **Smart Waste Management System** is an IoT-based project designed to automate and optimize the process of waste collection.  
It uses **sensors, motors, and wireless communication** to monitor waste levels, detect obstacles, and control robotic movement for efficient collection and disposal.

This system reduces manual labor, saves time, and promotes cleaner environments by ensuring timely waste collection.

## üöÄ Features
- **Smart Dustbin Monitoring**  
  - Ultrasonic sensor detects the waste level inside the bin.  
  - LCD display shows the fill percentage.  

- **Bluetooth/Remote Control Car**  
  - Motor driver and Bluetooth module allow the car to move **forward, backward, left, and right**.  
  - Controlled wirelessly using a smartphone.  

- **Robotic Arm with Servo Motors**  
  - Six DOF robotic arm to pick and drop waste items.  
  - Controlled via Bluetooth commands.  

- **Real-Time Distance Measurement**  
  - Ultrasonic sensor ensures the vehicle avoids obstacles.  

- **Automation & Alerts**  
  - LCD provides real-time feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
1. **Monitoring Waste Bin**  
   - The ultrasonic sensor checks the waste level and sends data to the Arduino.  

2. **Vehicle Navigation**  
   - User controls the car wirelessly via Bluetooth commands.  
   - The car moves to the waste bin location.  

3. **Robotic Arm Operation**  
   - Servo motors control the robotic arm to pick and dispose of waste.  
   - Commands like *open gripper, close gripper, lift arm* are mapped to Bluetooth inputs.  

4. **Obstacle Detection**  
   - If the car encounters an obstacle, ultrasonic sensor detects it.  
   - Car movement is adjusted to avoid collision.  

5. **Display Output**  
   - LCD continuously displays distance/waste level.
